            <p>
                This is my technology page.<br />
                I use programs such as Netbeans and Css to create websites such as this one before you.

                Html is one of the languages I am using in my programming of this website.<br />
                It is a type of code used to create and edit what you see and read off of the internet.<br />
                Css is another of the code languages I used to make this website as it edits certain Html code.
